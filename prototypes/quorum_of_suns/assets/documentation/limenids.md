# The Limenids — Threshold Minds
*Version 0.1 (design draft)*

**Tagline:** One body, many bodies. Minds born at the threshold.

A Limenid “individual” is a *vessel*—a mobile bio-mechanical suit—inhabited by hundreds of slug-like **motes** that coordinate via pheromone exchange. Selfhood emerges only within a **cohesion window** (too few motes: animal; too many: cognitive fragmentation or “fugue bloom”). Their society optimizes airflows, chemistries, and suit-tech to keep persons inside that window. They think slightly slower than humans, but their deliberation is deep, stable, and relentlessly methodical.

## Fantasy Overview
- **Identity:** Threshold minds; quorum as personhood.  
- **Pace:** Slightly slower cognition, compensated by high reliability and superb coordination.  
- **Ethos:** Order, tending, custodianship; ventilation and chemistry as civic arts.  
- **Edge:** Adaptive ground presence, interior/urban supremacy, and distributed resilience.

---

## Biology & Cognition
**Motes**  
- Centimeter-scale, chemo-communicating organisms; lifespan ≈ 2 years; reproduce by budding.  
- Carry fragmentary memory traces in chemosensory gradients and protein complexes.

**Vessels (Host Suits)**  
- Bio-mech shells with microfluidic **chemo-lattices** that circulate and modulate pheromones, accelerating consensus to near-human thought speeds.  
- Provide moisture control, thermal regulation, and shock isolation; weight limits high-G maneuvering.

**Cohesion Window**  
- Example baseline: **300–900 motes** per vessel → stable personhood.  
- \<300: “**dim**” (pre-personal swarm).  
- \>900: “**fugue bloom**” (contradictory decision vectors, degraded agency).  
- Window can be **narrowed** for stability or **broadened** for creative variance (policy/tech dependent).

**Memory & Reproduction**  
- When a vessel splits motes to seed a new vessel, memories **fork**. Ritual recombination (merging motes) allows partial **merge** of autobiographical traces. Identity is legally scentline-based, not strictly continuous.

---

## Society & Culture
**Governance — Pherocracy**  
- Deliberation via **scent halls** with controlled airflow; votes are emitted blends with verifiable signatures.  
- Law encodes safe cohesion ranges, vessel licensing, and environmental standards (humidity/ventilation rights).

**Kinship — Scentlines**  
- Descent traced through mote ancestry; inheritances are **mote allotments** plus vessel permits.  
- Coming-of-scent rituals calibrate a person’s preferred window.

**Art & Writing**  
- **Scent-glyphs**: microcapsule inks that release time-staged bouquets; texts are “performed” by vent choreography.  
- Music emphasizes layered cycles and shutter-rhythms (ventilation louvers as instruments).

---

## Technology
- **Chemo-Lattice Cores:** Microfluidic networks that speed pheromonal consensus; also enable encrypted **whisper blends** (short-range secure comms).  
- **Adaptive Vessels:** Smart tendons and ribbed capillaries for profile-shift, slither, brace; excel in tight interiors.  
- **Nursery Kilns:** Portable bioreactors for mote budding and imprinting.  
- **Purge Vents:** Rapid off-gassing to shed excess motes pre-fugue.  
- **Aroma Engineering:** Standardized blends for identity, commands, and industrial signaling.

---

## Warfare Doctrine
**Strengths**  
- Urban/indoor supremacy; breach-and-hold; synchronization resilient to electronic warfare.  
- High attrition tolerance via reseeding and fast re-cohesion logistics.

**Weaknesses**  
- Slower strategic pivots; vulnerability to desiccants/oxidizers and extreme thermal gradients.  
- Heavy vessels limit zero-g agility and high-G evasive maneuvers.

**Iconic Unit: Cohort-Sapper**  
- Sawtooth vessel frame, foam projectors (sealants/obscurants), scent-mesh comms, **mote coffers** to keep squads in window during losses.

## Gameplay Design (4X + Flagship)
> The Limenids are a stability-first faction with adjacency economies, indoor combat bonuses, and a unique **Cohesion** population model. Their flagship interfaces with stations/derelicts via **Ventboarding** (an FTL/Pixel-Starships-style subgame).

### Faction Identity
- **Species Trait — Quorum Sense:**  
  Cities/colonies connected by a ventilation network grant mutual adjacency bonuses to **Stability** and **Industry**. Bonus scales with network depth (diminishing returns).

- **Cohesion Economy:**  
  Population tracked as **Motes** and **Vessels**. Policies adjust the cohesion window:  
  - **Narrow Window:** +Stability, −Innovation, lower fugue risk.  
  - **Broad Window:** +Innovation chance on long projects, −Stability, higher fugue risk.

- **Research Profile:**  
  −10% base research speed; **Methodical Iteration** guarantees periodic break-throughs on projects ≥ X months (configurable). Synergy bonuses when tech “Aroma Tags” combine (e.g., *Flow*, *Sealant*, *Lattice*).

### Unique Infrastructure
- **Vent Stack (District):**  
  Creates controlled airflow grid; grants Stability/Industry adjacency, unlocks **Scent Hall** civic actions.  
- **Purge Garden (Building):**  
  Converts excess motes into growth buffers; reduces **Fugue Bloom** risk; small Culture yield from public rituals.  
- **Nursery Kiln (Building):**  
  Increases growth (Motes) and improves **fork/merge** memory outcomes.

### Unique Units
- **Cohort-Sapper (Infantry):** +25% combat in cities/indoors; can deploy **Sealant Foam** to create temporary cover/airlocks.  
- **Vessel-Engineer (Support):** Repairs structures, improves Vent Stack output, performs emergency **Purge** to stabilize allied stacks.

### Flagship Mechanic — Ventboarding
- Dock with stations/derelicts to spawn a **boarding vessel** instance (top-down rooms, systems, crews).  
- Systems emphasize **Flow Control** (open/close vents), **Sealant Foam**, **Whisper Blend** comms, and **Mote Coffers** (crew reinforcement).  
- Success yields tech fragments, aroma recipes, or unique crew.

### Crisis Event — Fugue Bloom
- Overcrowded worlds roll for **Fugue Bloom**: production loss, rogue decisions, or spawning hostile stacks.  
- Counterplay: build Purge Gardens, enact **Purge Protocols**, or export excess motes.

## Origin Variants (Story Starts)
- **Sundered Aroma:** Home seas flash-sterilized by a solar event; start dispersed across multiple systems; advanced chemo-lattices, fragile early economy.  
- **Vessel’s Vow:** Religious vow to the *Narrow Window*; very high Stability, low growth, unique diplomatic rituals.  
- **Gardeners of War:** Terraformers of hostile biospheres; bonuses to siege/terraform, moderate research penalties off-biome.

---

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Materials:** Matte ceramics, bone-white composites, glassy ribbed capillaries, pulsing micro-valves.  
- **Silhouette:** Low profile, segmented; cables and vents as “musculature.”  
- **UI Motifs:** Braided contour lines, translucent scent plumes, louver animations for loading/progress.  
- **Audio:** Slow rising chords that subdivide; percussive shutter clicks; gentle airflow beds.

---

## Names & Exonyms
- **Endonym:** Limenids (from *limen*, “threshold”).  
- **Polity:** The **Osmarchy** (rule by scent).  
- **Exonyms/Alternates (flavor):** Quorates, Tessellari, Congerants, Synoecians.

---

## Glossary
- **Mote:** Slug-like chemo-communicator forming part of a person.  
- **Vessel:** Bio-mech suit hosting motes; the mobile “body.”  
- **Cohesion Window:** Mote count range supporting personhood.  
- **Fugue Bloom:** Cognitive fragmentation above the upper threshold.  
- **Chemo-Lattice:** Microfluidic matrix for pheromone processing.  
- **Whisper Blend:** Encrypted pheromonal comms pattern.

## Numerical Tuning (v0.1)
> **Note:** All values are scaffolding for prototyping.

**Global Modifiers**

**Ventboarding Systems (prototype)**
- Flow Control level affects enemy pathing speed (−10% per level, up to −40%)  
- Sealant Foam: creates barrier with **100 HP** decaying over **15s**  
- Mote Coffers: 1 charge = **+50 motes** to crew pool; **2s** cognitive stun on use (brief slowdown)

## Balancing Levers
- Window width vs. research innovation rate.  
- Vent network scaling and adjacency cap.  
- Fugue Bloom probability curve and mitigation strength.  
- Indoor combat bonus vs. open-terrain penalties (optional future lever).  
- Flagship Ventboarding rewards (tech fragments vs. economy pacing).
