# The Edenites (Humans) — Protohuman Polities of Ra
*Version 0.1 (design draft)*

**Tagline:** Sun-called pioneers. Fragile now, ferocious later.

“Humans” in this era are **Edenites**—protohuman lineages native to **Eden**, the third planet of the **Ra** system. They are late-tribal to early-urban societies with nascent metallurgy, astronomy, and ritual engineering. Though technologically behind offworld powers, they are unmatched at **improvisation**, **frontier survival**, and **cross-discipline synthesis** once exposed to advanced knowledge. Their ascent is messy but meteoric.

## Fantasy Overview
- **Identity:** Protohuman generalists; rapid learners with myth-backed curiosity.  
- **Pace:** Explosive growth after contact; snowballs if given room.  
- **Ethos:** Frontier cooperation, tinkering, oral scholarship, sky-watching.  
- **Edge:** Adaptability, jury-rigging under pressure, asymmetric ground tactics.

---

## Biology & Cognition
- **Physiology:** Baseline human stock; high aerobic capacity, broad diet tolerance, robust thermoregulation.  
- **Cognition:** Strong pattern detection and tool transfer—skills migrate between domains (hunting → engineering, stargazing → navigation).  
- **Neuroculture:** Ritual mnemonic systems (songlines, knot-cords, star-lore boards) let small groups retain complex, proto-scientific models.

---

## Society & Culture
**Polities**  
- City-states and federated clans around river deltas and highland terraces.  
- **Skyward Guilds** manage calendars, eclipses, and long-count star cycles tied to Ra’s activity.

**Economy**  
- Mixed subsistence with early craft specialization (ceramics, bronze/iron bloom, resin composites).  
- Reputation-based credit: **Boons** owed between houses; later convertible into formal currency.

**Knowledge Systems**  
- **Lorehouses** (libraries/workshops) compile star charts, metallurgy rites, and practical theorems.  
- Oral epics encode disaster playbooks (famine, flood, plague) → quick policy uptake during crises.

---

## Technology Baseline & Trajectory
- **Baseline:** Late bronze/early iron equivalents; animal traction, waterworks, wind vanes, primitive optics.  
- **Trajectory:** Given access to offworld scraps or instruction, Edenites leapfrog by **refactoring** known tools (e.g., wind vanes → turbine theory; kilns → microfurnaces).  
- **Signature Methods:** Joinery-as-structure (laminated woods/composites), cord-tension machines, acid-etched patterning, modular carts → rovers.

---

## Warfare Doctrine
**Strengths**  
- Skirmish superiority, ambushes, sappers, and field fortification speed.  
- Flexible command: small-unit leaders make on-the-spot kit swaps and terrain calls.

**Weaknesses**  
- Thin armor vs. advanced kinetics/energetics until midgame.  
- Logistics brittle off-homeworld until supply techs unlock.

**Iconic Unit: Pathbreaker**  
- Scout-sapper hybrid; lays **tension bridges**, sets **smoke lime** (line-of-sight denial), repurposes enemy debris mid-battle.

---

## Gameplay Design (4X + Flagship)
> Edenites start behind on paper but accelerate through **Improvisation** and **Resolve** mechanics. Their flagship leans into crew heroics and on-the-fly reconfiguration.

### Faction Identity
- **Species Trait — Improvisers:**  
  Cities and fleets can attempt **Jury-Rig Projects** that provide temporary versions of buildings/modules without prerequisites. Success scales with **Resolve**; failures can cause brief instability or module wear.

- **Secondary Trait — Cross-Training:**  
  When finishing a technology, the two nearest techs on the tree gain **Insight** stacks; stacking reduces their future cost (captures “skills transfer”).

- **Faction Resource — Resolve:**  
  Earned from adversity: low Stability, siege, attrition, disasters survived, first-contact setbacks. Spent to:  
  - Guarantee a Jury-Rig success.  
  - Trigger **Crew Gambits** on the flagship.  
  - Convert to burst Research or Production during crises.

### Unique Infrastructure
- **Lorehouse (Building):**  
  +Science, +Culture; stores up to 3 **Insights**; once per era, cash in all Insights to finish a tech segment.  
- **Foundry Yard (District):**  
  Early Industry with **Refactor** action: scrap one building to grant partial production toward another of a different type.  
- **Skywatch Stones (Building):**  
  Strategic-scan range around a settlement; small Stability from seasonal festivals.

### Unique Units
- **Pathbreaker (Recon/Sapper):** High vision, builds makeshift cover, deploys **Smoke Lime** (−accuracy zone).  
- **Wright-Engineer (Support):** Field repairs, enhances Jury-Rig success chance nearby, converts debris to barricades.

### Flagship Mechanic — Crew Gambits
- **Gambits** are one-off, crew-led stunts powered by **Resolve**:  
  - **Overcrank:** Temporarily boosts reactor/thrusters; causes module wear.  
  - **Hot-Patch:** Instantly restores a disabled system at reduced max HP.  
  - **Decoy Lure:** Jettisons a tuned scrap cloud to spoof enemy targeting for a few seconds.  
- **Hardpoint Philosophy:** Fewer fixed slots; more **universal bracers** that accept downgraded versions of higher-tier modules (fits the Jury-Rig fantasy).

### Diplomacy & Events
- **First Light Protocols:** Early penalties to formal diplomacy, but unique **Oath Pacts** that scale with trust: each fulfilled promise banks Resolve; each betrayal stings.  
- **Contact Sparks:** First contact with advanced civs places **Catalysts** on the tree—cheaper techs that mirror whatever you just saw used against you.

---

## Origin Variants (Story Starts)
- **Ra’s Children:** Start isolated on Eden with lush biomes and volatile weather cycles; bonus food/industry, periodic storms that generate Resolve.  
- **The Shattered Archive:** Begin with a hidden pre-cataclysm cache on Eden; reveal random mid-tier techs, but stability penalties from relic cults.  
- **Strangers’ Fire:** Offworld crash site within reach from turn 1; immediate access to Jury-Rig modules, harsher diplomacy malus from scavenging.

---

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Materials:** Sun-burnished wood, hammered metals, resin cordage, bone/stone inlays transitioning to composite frames and brasswork.  
- **Silhouette:** Practical, layered clothing/armor; rigs, braces, satchels; flagship interiors show rope-tied conduits and labeled patchwork panels.  
- **UI Motifs:** Solar glyphs, radial calendars, cord patterns; progress wheels that “notch” like an astrolabe.  
- **Audio:** Hand drums, breath flutes, work chants blended with ticking escapements and turbine whoosh as tech rises.

---

## Names & Exonyms
- **Endonym:** Edenites (various polities use house/river names).  
- **Home System:** **Ra**.  
- **Homeworld:** **Eden**.  
- **Polity Examples:** House of Eastwind, River-Loom League, The Stone-Counting Compact.  
- **Common Exonym:** “Humans.”

---

## Glossary
- **Resolve:** Faction resource accrued via adversity; fuels improvisation and heroics.  
- **Jury-Rig Projects:** Temporary buildings/modules created without full prerequisites.  
- **Insight:** Cost-reduction stacks granted to neighboring techs after a discovery.  
- **Crew Gambit:** Flagship one-off stunt powered by Resolve.

## Numerical Tuning (v0.1)
> **Note:** Scaffolding for prototyping; tune to your economy pacing.

**Global Modifiers**
- Research Speed: **+5%** (base)  
- Stability: **−1** per city when at war (reflects political strain)  
- Diplomacy: **−10** starting opinion with advanced FTL civs (culture shock)

**Traits**
- Improvisers — Jury-Rig base success: **60%**; success grants **temporary module/building** for **10 turns** (cities) or **2 combats** (ships). On failure: **−1 Stability** (city) or **−10% system HP** (ship module).  
- Cross-Training — Each completed tech grants **2 Insight stacks** to the two adjacent techs; each stack **−4%** cost (cap **−24%** per tech).

**Resolve**
- Earn: +1 per turn under siege; +3 per city that ends turn at Stability ≤ 0; +5 on losing a battle; +8 surviving a disaster event.  
- Spend: 5 to guarantee a Jury-Rig; 8 for a Crew Gambit; 12 to add **+25%** Research or Production for **1 turn** in a city.

**Units/Buildings**
- Pathbreaker: sight **+2**, Smoke Lime zone **10s**, enemy accuracy **−20%** inside.  
- Wright-Engineer: adjacent Jury-Rig success **+15%**, repair **6%/turn** to structures.  
- Lorehouse: +4 Science, +2 Culture; cash-in action completes **25%** of a tech per **Insight** stored (consumes all).  
- Skywatch Stones: +1 Stability (festival), +2 sensor range on planet.

**Flagship**
- Gambits (cost 8 Resolve):  
  - Overcrank: +30% thrust for **6s**, **10%** wear to engines.  
  - Hot-Patch: restore a disabled system to **40%** HP, max HP **−10%** this combat.  
  - Decoy Lure: enemies retarget to decoy for **5s** or until hit **3** times.

---

## Balancing Levers
- Resolve earn/spend rates and what triggers them.  
- Jury-Rig duration and failure penalties.  
- Cross-Training adjacency radius (2 neighbors vs. ring of 6 on a hex tree).  
- Diplomacy malus decay when Edenites reach parity tech tiers.  
- Flagship Gambit potency vs. wear to curb spam.
