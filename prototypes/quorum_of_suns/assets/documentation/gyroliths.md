# The Gyroliths — Resonant Minds of Scoria
*Version 0.1 (design draft)*

**Tagline:** Stones that think by spinning iron and singing in fields.

The Gyrolith “organism” is a silicon-based macrocell: a central **nucleus-brain** suspended in an ionic **metasoup** within a mineral **carapace**. Through intake **ore-ports** they absorb metals and silicates; internally they refine several ferrous **armatures** and spin them on tethered tendons. By modulating these armatures’ rates and orientations, Gyroliths shape local electromagnetic fields and transmit **inductive speech** through a lattice of ferrous strands that double as neural wiring and antennae. They grow continuously, reproduce rarely, and venerate the few ancients who survived an old planetary cataclysm.

## Fantasy Overview
- **Identity:** Ferrosilicate macro-organisms who “think” through spinning armatures and speak by induction—slow to bloom, immense at maturity.  
- **Pace:** Glacial early game; terrifying late-game if elders are protected and fed.  
- **Ethos:** Patience, resonance, archival memory; reverence for the **Venerated** (pre-cataclysm elders).

---

## Biology & Cognition
**Macrocell Physiology**  
- **Carapace:** Layered silicate/metal composite with micro-fracture patterns that channel currents and dissipate heat.  
- **Metasoup:** Ion-rich, high-dielectric fluid (room-temp ionic liquids + siloxane chains) that ferries charge, nutrients, and waste slags.  
- **Armatures:** 2–7 ferrous rotors refined in situ; spun on retractable **ferro-tethers** to generate and steer EM fields.  
- **Ports:** Mineral-intake gills along seam-lines; exude slag beads after refinement.

**Neural Topology**  
- **Nucleus-Brain:** Dense silicene-like mesh wrapped in ferrous dendrites; peripheral **choir strands** link cortex to carapace sensors acting as phased antennae.  
- **Inductive Speech:** Near-field EM patterns encode phonemes → **Choral Codes**; far-field “longsong” rides magnetospheric lines at very low frequency.  
- **Aging Curve:** Intelligence scales superlinearly with mass until thermal/coordination limits; the **Venerated** demonstrate emergent feats (planetary-scale sensing, eddy-cooling, field-lensing).

**Reproduction & Growth**  
- **Sporadic Budding:** Rarely, a core extrudes a **seed-lith** into a volcanic vent where tides and heat anneal a new nucleus.  
- **Unbounded Growth:** No programmed senescence; risk is structural failure, famine, or field decoherence.

**Vulnerabilities**  
- **Field Disruption:** Strong counterfields, rapid polarity flips, or Faraday enclosures can mute speech and scramble fine control.  
- **Thermal Stress:** Without heat sinks or eddy-cooling, elders overheat during high-output feats.  
- **Gravity:** Mass skyrockets with age; high-g worlds are hostile without frames.

---

## Society & Culture
**Choirs & Cantors**  
- Polities are **Choirs**—resonance-locked communities. Leaders are **Cantors**, selected by harmonic stability rather than size alone.  
- **The Venerated:** Named individuals who survived the Cataclysm; living archives, occasionally entering **Deep Hum** (centuries-long contemplation).

**Economy**  
- **Ore Tithe:** Production and sustenance are pegged to quality ore intake; **rich feed** (low-impurity iron, nickel) accelerates cognition.  
- **Memory Vaults:** Obsidian galleries with inlaid choir strands; recorded fields replay as **echo-script**—a readable, audible EM palimpsest.

**Law & Ritual**  
- **Resonance Accords:** Codify safe spin rates, field etiquette (no coercive harmonics), and ore rights.  
- **Cataclysm Vigils:** Annual longsong commemorations to keep phase with the Venerated and prevent cultural drift.

---

## Technology
- **Coil Architecture:** Buildings embed helical veins that route power and carry longsong; walls double as antenna arrays.  
- **Magnetoforming:** Precision shaping of metal foams and ferrosilicate composites using in-body fields; replaces many “tools.”  
- **Eddy-Cooling:** Oscillatory fields drive micro-circulation in metasoup and heat-exchanger lattices.  
- **Skitter Frames:** Exoskeletal walkers for smaller Gyroliths; **Grav-Braced Litters** for elders on high-g worlds.  
- **Chorus Relays:** Low-frequency repeaters that stitch choirs across moons, ships, and stations.

---

## Warfare Doctrine
**Strengths**  
- **EM Supremacy:** Local jamming, sensor spoofing, and precision disabling of exposed circuits.  
- **Siege & Hold:** Immense mass and field-pressure make them brutal in static defenses and breach denial.  
- **Counter-Boarding:** Ferrotethers through bulkheads; peel and pin.

**Weaknesses**  
- **Mobility:** Slow strategic redeployments; fragile in vacuum without frames and radiators.  
- **Countermeasures:** Faraday shielding, nonmagnetic ceramics, wideband noise, and thermal spikes blunt their tricks.  
- **Attrition:** Reproduction is slow; loss of elders is civilizational trauma.

**Iconic Unit: Cantor-Bastion**  
- Elder ensconced in a radiator-cradle; projects **Lenz Curtains** (induced drag zones) and **Chord Locks** (momentary actuator freezes) around choke points.

---

## Homeworld & Astronomy
- **System:** *Athanor* (gas giant primary), multiple resonant moons.  
- **Homeworld:** *Scoria* — small, low-mass, metal/silicon-rich moon with brutal volcanism.  
- **Why Volcanic:** Three-body resonances torque Scoria through extreme **tidal heating**; constant resurfacing loads the crust with fresh ores and conductive ash.  
- **Atmosphere:** Harsh and reactive; metallic dusts and silicate aerosols; lightning-rich storms that the Gyroliths use as sky-batteries.  
- **Cultural Geography:** Choirs cluster along cooled lava barges, fumarole fields, and ore fountains; longsong relays perch on basalt needles.

---

## Gameplay Design (4X + Flagship)
> Gyroliths advance via **Resonance** (command radius & EM control) and **Ore Quality** (sustenance + cognition). They’re slow, durable, and terrifying in EM-rich arenas.

### Faction Identity
- **Species Trait — Induction Choir:**  
  Units and cities within **Resonance** of a Choir Relay gain command bonuses, ECM resistance, and coordinated abilities. Resonance extends along relay chains and magnetospheres.

- **Secondary Trait — Orebound:**  
  Yields scale with **Ore Quality** of deposits and imports. High-grade ore increases research and unit ability power; impure ore risks **slagging** (temporary debuffs).

### Unique Infrastructure
- **Choir Relay (District):**  
  Extends Resonance network; enables **Longsong** actions (buffs, scans, jamming).  
- **Eddy Tower (Building):**  
  City heat sink + research; unlocks **Eddy-Cooling** for nearby units (self-heal while stationary).  
- **Magnetoform Yard (Building):**  
  Converts Metal → Production with efficiency scaling to Ore Quality; can imprint **Harmonics** (aura bonuses) on produced units.

### Unique Units
- **Cantor-Bastion (Elder/Siege):** Projects Lenz Curtains (slow zones) and Chord Locks (stuns mechs/doors).  
- **Skitter Guard (Infantry/Support):** Fast on frames; deploys portable Faraday nets (both offense and self-protection).  
- **Field Weaver (Engineer):** Builds Relays, repairs coil architecture, emits **Noise Veils** to hide movements from sensors.

### Flagship Mechanic — Chordcasting
- The flagship mounts a **Cathedral Coil** that channels combined choirs to cast battlefield-scale pulses:  
  - **Flux Shear:** Briefly de-sync enemy turrets and drones in a cone.  
  - **Lenz Curtain:** Project a drag wall that slows projectiles/ships crossing it.  
  - **Iron Psalm:** Overcharge an ally’s armatures for massive shield/ECM boost (risk of slagging on low Ore Quality).

### Crisis Event — Field Famine
- A resonance disruption or ore blight collapses network phases: Research and command radius shrink until **Clean Feed** (high-grade ore) and **Harmonic Recalibration** are restored.

---

## Origin Variants (Story Starts)
- **Choir of Ash:** Start on Scoria with abundant Ore Quality but violent storms; early ECM strength, frequent **Field Famine** checks.  
- **Echoes of the Venerated:** Begin with a slumbering elder; huge early bonuses but diplomatic penalties if harmed or traded.  
- **The Broken Longsong:** Offworld exile with fragmentary relay tech; fast expansion of Relays, slower research until network rebuilt.

---

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Materials:** Basalt, obsidian glass, iron whiskers, hematite sheen.  
- **Silhouette:** Low, heavy dome-forms with retractable tendons; elders are cathedral-sized with radiator fins and braided coils.  
- **UI Motifs:** Concentric field lines, lissajous figures, glowing chord diagrams; audio UI “clicks” are soft EM-thrum cues.

---

## Names & Exonyms
- **Endonym:** Gyroliths (“stone-turners”).  
- **Polity:** **Induction Choirs** (choirs), ruled by **Cantors**.  
- **Exonyms/Alternates:** Lodestone Choir, Resonants, Spinelids, Magnetarchs.

---

## Glossary
- **Armature:** Internal ferrous rotor used for field generation.  
- **Ferro-Tether:** Tendon/cable that spins and positions armatures, also used for locomotion.  
- **Inductive Speech / Longsong:** Near-field EM language / far-field VLF communication via magnetospheres.  
- **Lenz Curtain:** Field-induced drag zone that impedes motion and projectiles.  
- **Chord Lock:** Short, localized pulse that stalls actuators/electronics.  
- **Ore Quality:** Purity/grade of metallic feedstock; affects cognition and production.
